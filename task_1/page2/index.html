            According to one legend, Prague’s magnificent destiny was prophesied
            even before its founding: <blockquote cite="http://www.czechtourism.com/tourists/stories/praha/">
            “I see a great city whose glory will touch the stars.”
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            These words utter by the mythical Princess Libuše supposedly
            determined the place in the deep forests around the river Vltava where
            the first inhabitants were to build a castle and thus the foundation for
            a new town.
          </p>
          <p>An inexplicable connection between the city and the stars, astronomy
            and astrological magic is characteristic of Prague to this day. Perhaps
            it is even thanks to some lucky star that Prague has managed to escape
            all major wars and disasters, allowing it to retain its unique character,
            in which architectural styles from an entire millennium blend into one
            picturesque whole whose parallel you will not find anywhere else in the world.

            Prague’s mysterious atmosphere has again and again captivated its visitors,
            among them the most prominent personalities of science, art and politics,
            who stopped at this crossroads in the middle of Europe or even tied their
            fate to the city for a longer time. But gives Prague its grace and beauty?
            What is her secret? From whence comes the “inexplicable supernatural" that
            the Czech writer Jakub Arbes notices in Prague?
          </p>
          <p> We never seem to find a simple answer, because something is hidden beneath the surface in Prague
            which is eludes our daily experience and defies our understanding. Whoever
            wants to get to know Prague must know something about her – something which
            cannot be read in even the best-researched guidebooks. That means only one thing –
            it is necessary to see her, to walk through her streets, and to see with your
            own eyes the city of eccentrics and visionaries, the restless heart of
            Central Europe, as it once was described by the German writer Oskar Wiener.
            Not even the best poem or novel can capture even a fraction of her mystery and beauty.
